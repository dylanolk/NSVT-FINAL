        <h2>So what's the deal with the Nyquist Shannon Theorem?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Nyquist-Shannon Theorem states that when representing an analog signal digitally,
			as long as your number of
            sampling points is at least twice as great as the signalâ€™s highest
            frequency, you can represent that signal using only those points without losing any
			information at all.
          </li>
          <li>
			This means if we resample an audio file to have a sampling rate that is 
			twice it's maximum detected frequency, we can greatly reduce the file size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our visualizer accepts a large audio file and reduces the amount of
            points without any audio loss or drop in quality.
          </li>
