        <h2>So what's the deal with the Nyquist Shannon Theorem?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Nyquist-Shannon Theorem is a technique to create a perfectly
            lossless representation of a sound wave using far less information.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Nyquist-Shannon Theorem states that as long as your number of
            sampling points is at least twice as great as the signalâ€™s highest
            frequency, you can create a wave using only those points without
            losing any information at all.
          </li>

            Our visualizer accepts a large audio file and reduces the amount of
            points without any audio loss or drop in quality.
